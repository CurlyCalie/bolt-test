A top-down estimation of market size,,,,
Unit economics with profitability per order,,,,
What conclusions can you come up with? Should we launch or not?,,,,
How would you measure success or failure if the launch happens? What KPIâ€™s can you come up with?,,,,

A top-down estimation of market size,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
"Launching a food delivery business in Dubai, UAE",,,,
total size of the market will depend on the number of restaurants and population in Dubai,,,,
,,,,
Metric,,Value,Source ,
Total Res Count in Dubai : ,,13000,source ,
Approximate Population of Dubai,,10170000,source ,
people per restaurant,,782,,
,,,,
the entire population will not be our target group for the launch ,,,,
we can assume that people between the ages 15-54 years of age will be our target demographic,,,,
which is approximately 8.3 million people ( source) ,,,,
,,,,
"making an assumtion that on average, a person orders in once a week",,,,
making it 4 orders per person per month,,,,

daily,"1,106,667",49800015,AED,price estimage source : link
,,,,
note : the average meal cost will depend on the type of restaurant the person is ordering from,,,,
"          while an inexpensive meal will cost somewhere between 30-60 AED, a mid range 3 course meal can cost upto 150 AED per person",,,,
"          it is also important to understand that not everyone in our target dempographic will choose to order from our delivery service, 
as some users might prefer calling up the restaurant and place an order directly from the source",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
unit economics with profitability per order,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
"on an order level, we can consider the business profitable if the net revenue per order is positive",,,,
"in order to figure this out, we will have to look at cost and revenue on an order level",,,,
"assuming that the business model intends to make money via the commissions that a restaurant is charged per order, the unit economics can be broken down as follows",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
user-transaction-amount,cost of order ( order value ) + delivery charges,,,
commission charged,20% of order value,,,
delivery radius of restaurant,<= 10KM,,,
delivery charge FROM restaurant,fixed cost + distance variable :: delivery charges applicable which will be dependent on the distance between the user and the restaurant,,,
delivery charge TO restaurant,"our delivery fleet will not be present at the restaurant, so cost will also include distnace charge from a hotspot where derivers are available to the restaurant",,,
,"we can not charge the user for this, so this will either have to be taken care of in the fixed charge or the commission charged",,,
small order fee,if applicable,,,
,,,,
,,,,
profitablilty on an order id level,,,,
"as the delivery charge will be borne by the user, an order will be profitable if :",,,,
20% of order value > delivery charge to restaurant,,,,
"for cases where order-value is small, and can not compensate for the distance cost from driver location to restaurant, we can charge an additional small-order-fee",,,,
"assuming that for an order, the user is on average, 5 kms away from the restaurant, and the driver is 3kms away from the restaurant",,,,

NOTE : fixed delivery charge can be calculated depending on the number of drivers we have and the number of hours they need to be compensated for,,,,

Should we Launch ?,,,,

weekly,"8,300,000",37433000,AED,
daily,"1,106,667",4991068.17,AED,
,,,,
,,,,
we can expect a monthly revenue of ~ 150 mil AED after a successful launch and adoption in UAE,,,,
challenges : ,,,,
"1. competition from other delivery apps in UAE like Talabat, Delivroo, etc",,,,
"2. so, pricing will have to reasonable enough for a user to shift from existing app to Bolt for Food Delivery",,,,
,"we can look into creating loyalty programs like every Nth order, delivery fee can be waived off for the user",,,
,"this also gives users an incentive to order more frequently, and helps with user retention",,,
"3. identify restaurant hotspots, and place delivery-riders at an optimal distance between restaurant and customer",,,,
,,,,
"post pandemic, people have gotten more used to getting stuff delivered home, and dubai seems like a lucrative market with a good restaurant scene",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
KPI,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
"post launch, we need to define metrics to keep track of whether the business is heading in the right road to more profitablity",,,,
"and also, to catch any unnecessary burns early on, and come up with a soltion to fix this problem",,,,
,,,,
metrics that we need to track are,,,,
,,,,
Metric,Definition,,,
Daily App Opens,this will give an idea about the potential number of orders that could have been placed on any given day,,,
Daily Active Users,unique users on a daily level,,,
Weekly Active Users,unique users on a weekly level,,,
Monthly Active Users,unique users on a monthly level,,,
Restaurant Page Opens,,,,
Menu Page Opens,,,,
Items Added to Cart,,,,
Order Placed,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
We can also track funnel metrics,,,,
a typical user journey should look like,,,,
App Open > Restaurant Page Opened > Menu Viewed > Items Added To Cart > Order Placed ,,,,
,,,,
"so, we can keep a track on funnel metrics like ->",,,,
,,,,
funnel,what it tells us,calc,,
app opens to res page opens,whether the user finds relevant results once he/she opens the app,resPageOpens x 100/appOpens,,
res page opens to menu opens,whether the information present on the listing makes the user want to check out the restaurants menu,menuOpens x 100/resPageOpens,,
menu opens to cart builds,% of users who add items to cart after viewing the menu,cartBuilds x 100/menuOpens,,
cart builds to orders placed,% of users who actually place an order after building the cart,ordersPlaced x 100/cartBuilds,,
app opens to order placed,% of conversion for every app open,ordersPlaced x 100/appOpens,,
,,,,
,,,,
Logistics and Operational Costs,,,,
,,,,
avg distance between driver and restaurant,,,,
avg delivery charge TO restaurant ,,,,
avg distance between user and restaurant,,,,
avg delivery charge TO restaurant ,,,,
avg total delivery costs,,,,
,,,,
Basic Health metrics,"on a daily, weekly and monthly level",,,
Average Order Value,,,,
Total Orders,,,,
Total Transaction Amount,,,,
Total Commission Charged,,,,
Delivery Charges,"in an ideal scenario, this can be used to compensate delivery partners",,,
total Delivering Restaurants,,,,
total Restaurant Shutdowns,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
we will need to keep an eye on these metrics to understand market trends like ,,,,
is the restaurant industry profitable? this will result in more new restaurants opening up,,,,
how many orders do we make in a day? how do we get this count up? maintain it ? get it back up in case of dips,,,,
do we make enough from delivery charges levied on users to compensate our delivery partners ?,,,,
