solution to problem 1 has both jupyter and pdf can be found in the folder : problem1

solution to problem 2 : tho i have uploaded the csv here, the formatting might be different depending on whether you open it on sheets, excel or some other
spreadsheet editor

hence, i would recommend viewing it in the original format intended : [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DnIbtY37BLi3Xz-8cX3I4Um5MznHjW8tNsFksemiSZY/edit#gid=0)




*Note to self* : there is a little laziness involved in my approach to solving the problem, instead of assuming that the problem has taken a few hours, and
that i am not sure whether people are expecting me to plot graphs and stuff, go all the way, use everything at your disposal and come up with a correct result
